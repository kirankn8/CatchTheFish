# CatchTheFish

Catch the fish is an interactive game featuring 2D retro style graphics. The
objective is to direct a flying bird to catch the jumping fish and eat them. If the player manages to
make the bird eat the fish, he earns a score of +1. However, if the bird misses the fish the score
decreases by -2 which is significant of the bird going hungry by not able to eat the fish pointed to
by the player and thereafter starving. The game ends if the points go negative and the maximum
score earned in the game is displayed.
